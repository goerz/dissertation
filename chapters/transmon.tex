\chapter{Quantum Gates with Superconducting Transmon Qubits}
\label{chap:transmon}

Superconducting circuits have emerged has one of the most promising
environments for quantum information processing. Unlike most other
implementations (e.g.\ trapped atoms like the Rydberg gate discussed in
chapter~\ref{chap:robust}), they are macroscopic, in the sense that the relevant
degrees of freedom are the quantities describing electrical circuits, such as
charge, current, or flux. However, unlike in classical electrical circuits,
these variables are now fully quantized and described by a wave function. The
quantum behavior results from the electrons forming Cooper pairs and condensing
to a \emph{collective} quantum state as the system is cooled below some
(material-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$ \cite{TinkhamBook}.

From a technical perspective, superconducting qubits have the significant
advantage of building upon fabrication techniques used in standard integrated
circuits. A superconducting layer of usually aluminum or niobium is layered on
a silicon wafer
\cite{DevoretQIP2004, FrunzioITAS2005}.
The circuit elements are then patterned using the standard tools of optical or
electron-beam lithography and chemical etching: a photo-sensitive ``resin''
material is added to the chip and the illuminated with UV light or an electron
beam through a mask. Then, the developed resin is removed and the
exposed superconducting material is etched away, or alternatively, electrical
leads are deposited in the resin gaps \cite{HirstSCHandbook2003}.
For superconducting circuits relevant to quantum computing, one of the central
components is the \emph{Josephson junction}, described below in
section~\ref{sec:jj}. It consists of two layers of superconducting material
separated by an insulating layer. This insulating layer in generally created by
oxidation of the superconducting material \cite{DevoretQIP2004,
FrunzioITAS2005}. Using these well-established production techniques,
a quantum computer based on a superconducting architecture could readily
produced industrially, provided that the more fundamental challenges in building
a large-scale quantum processor can be met, i.e.\ implementing universal quantum
gates and scaling the circuit to a significant number of qubits while
maintaining coherence.

This chapter reviews the fundamentals of superconducting qubits, with emphasis
on the \emph{transmon} design, as well as the gate mechanisms that have been
used to implement two-qubit gates using transmons. We start by explaining the
Josephson junction as the quint-essential non-linear element in
superconducting circuits. The three traditional qubit designs -- the Cooper pair
box (``charge qubit''), the RF-SQUID (``flux qubit''), and the current-biased
Josephson Junction (``phase qubit'') -- are briefly discussed before moving to
the transmon qubit, which improves upon the traditional qubits with
significantly enhanced decoherence times. Finally, some of the gate mechanism
that have been used to to implement two-qubit gates on transmon qubits are
summarized, before ending with a general discussion of the decoherence
properties of the transmon.

  quantities from the which the tunneling energy and the
  capacitive energy of the junction derive, and which allow to formulate the
  Hamiltonian.  The ``phase'' $\delta$ is more properly known as the
  ``gauge-invariant phase difference'' across the junction. The last group

\end{figure}

The Josephson junction consists of two superconducting leads separated by a thin
insulating layer, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jj}. This structure acts as
a capacitor with capacitance $C_j$. From classical electrodynamics, if one of
the leads (capacitor plates) holds a charge of $Q$, the energy stored in the
capacitor is
\begin{equation}
  E_{cap} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C_J}
  \label{eq:E_capacity}
\end{equation}
In addition to the capacitive effect, Cooper pairs of electrons can tunnel
through the insulating layer (owing to the quantum mechanical nature of the
circuit), resulting in a \emph{Josephson current}.
The behavior at the is governed by two equations: First, the branch flux of any
electrical element can be obtained from the voltage $V$ across that element.
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} V(t') \dd t'
  \label{eq:branchflux}
\end{equation}
Second, the Josephson junction has a characteristic non-linear relation between
the tunneling current through that junction and the branch flux
\cite{JosephsonAP1965},
\begin{equation}
  I(t) = I_0 \sin \delta(t)
  = I_0 \sin \frac{2 \pi \Phi(t)}{\Phi_0}
  = I_0 \sin \frac{\Phi(t)}{\phi_0}
  \label{eq:jjcurrent}
\end{equation}
Here, $I_0$ is the maximum current the junction can support, and $\delta(t)$ is
the phase difference of wave functions on each side of the junction, which is
directly related to the branch flux $\Phi(t)$ of the junction element. All the
quantities typically used to describe the junction are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:jj_params}.

If the junction holds an initial charge difference (``offset charge'') of $Q_r$
and $N$ Cooper pairs of electrons (charge $2e$) tunnel through the junction, the
capacitive energy of the junction according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:E_capacity}) is
\begin{equation}
  E_{cj} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{(2e)^2}{C_J} \left( N - \frac{Q_r}{2e} \right)^2
\end{equation}
Note that the offset charge $Q_r/2e$ will generally be much larger then $N$, and
cannot easily be controlled during the production process.
The energy due to the tunneling current is given by
\begin{equation}
  E_{Ij} = \int_{-\infty}^{t} I(t') V(t') dt' = -E_J \cos \delta\,,
\end{equation}

with $E_J$ defined in Table~\ref{tab:jj_params}. Together, both terms yield the
Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \Op{H}_{jj}
  = E_c \left( \Op{N} - \frac{Q_r}{2e} \right)^2
    - E_{J} \cos \Op{\theta}\,.
 \label{eq:H_JJ}
\end{equation}

\section{Traditional Superconducting Qubits}

The Hamiltonian in Eq.~(\ref{eq:H_JJ}) is dominated by the value of $Q_r$,
obtains a random value during the production process and makes the naked
Josephson Junction ill-suited as a qubit. To obtain a well-defined qubit, there
are three ``traditional'' superconducting qubit designs that add further
elements to the Josephson-Junction circuit: the Cooper pair box (``charge
qubit'') the flux qubit, and the phase qubit.

\begin{equation}
  \Op{n} \ee^{\ii \Op{\phi}}
  = \ii \frac{\partial}{\partial\Op{\phi}} \ee^{\ii \Op{\phi}}
  = \ee^{\ii \Op{\phi}} \left( \Op{N} + 1 \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \Op{H} = 4 E_C \left( \Op{N} - N_r \right)
          - \frac{E_J}{2} \sum_n \left(
            \KetBra{n}{n+1} + \KetBra{n+1}{n}
          \right)
\end{equation}

  \caption{Parameter sets}
  \label{tab:RIP_entang_params}
\end{table}

Another perspective under which to analyze different parameter sets is the
creation of entanglement for Gaussian/Blackmann pulses of increasing amplitude.
We examine a set of system parameters listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:RIP_entang_params}.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{rip_entanglement}
  \caption{Entanglement (concurrence) generated after $T=\SI{200}{ns}$, for
  Blackmann pulse of varying maximum amplitude. $d$ is the detuning of the
  drive from the cavity, $d = \omega_d - \omega_c$ (i.e.\ negative numbers
  indicate driving left of the cavity, positive number right of the cavity).
  In the legend for each line, the number of cavity and qubits
  levels included in the propagation are indicated in parenthesis, for the value
  of $E_0$ at which the entanglement reaches its first local extremum. E.g., the
  curve for $d = \SI{-60}{MHz}$ for parameter set 1 (blue curve in top
  panel) requires 30 cavity levels and 11 qubit levels in order to be converged
  for a pulse amplitude of $E_0 \approx \SI{250}{MHz}$, where a concurrence of 1.0
  is reached.
  The panels from top to bottom correspond to the parameter sets listed in
  Tab.~\ref{tab:RIP_entang_params}}
  \label{fig:rip_entanglement}
\end{figure}

The entanglement reached after propagating for $T=\SI{200}{ns}$  for these
parameter sets, and with a drive at varying frequencies left or right of the
cavity, as given by $d$, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rip_entanglement}. Note how the
entanglement generated by the drive can interfere either constructively or
destructively with the field-free entanglement. The field-free entanglement is
due to the static coupling of the qubit and the cavity.

The curve for parameter set 1, $d=-60$ shows a significant qubit level
excitation (11 qubit levels needed for numerical convergence). This is
counter-intuitive, since the cavity is left of the qubits and the drive is left
of the cavity, and thus should be far off-resonant for the qubit transition.
However, the population dynamics show an excitation $\Ket{1} \rightarrow
\Ket{3}$ of the left qubit.
