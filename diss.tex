% # Special Feature Notes #
% To use lettrines, you may do e.g.
%
%    lettrine[lines=2]{Q}{uantum effects}

% Before a chapter, you may insert a quote like the following:
%
%   \begin{savequote}[75mm]
%   It is often stated that of all the theories proposed in this century, the
%   silliest is quantum theory. In fact, some say that the only thing that quantum
%   theory has going for it is that it is unquestionably correct.
%   \qauthor{Michio Kaku (\textit{Hyperspace})}
%   \end{savequote}
%
% To set the first part of a sentense in small caps, use
% \newthought{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet}
